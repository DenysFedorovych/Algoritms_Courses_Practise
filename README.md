# Algoritms Courses Practise
Here are my own implementations of practice exercises by [Algorithms Part I-II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course by Princeton University.

To use this programs you need to install special [library](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) to your IDEA, or you can just enjoy description with images.

# 1. Seam Carving

## Target:
Resize the given image without cuting important elements and without compressing it and losing content.
## Example:

## What was in use:
*    Specific Dijkstra algorithm with Topological order
*    Dual-gradient energy function
## How to use it:
1.    Make sure you have download library from the top of the description
2.    Start class ResizeDemo
3.    Follow the instructions
